This version of BLT has been modified in the following way:

We added a CMake system that replaces the old make system. This impacts the 
src/bltConfig.h.in and src/bltHash.in, as they now need #cmakedefine instead of #define.

The other modifications were bug fixes to ensure that the code compiles with new TCL/TK versions:

We modified
src/bltScrollbar.c
src/bltTed.c
src/bltInit.c
src/BltNsUtil.h
src/BltVecMath.c

The changes were limited to the changes required by an API change in TCL. Some functions now require a const char* instead of a char*, and The_interp does not have a field result anymore and needs an additional function call to obtain the result field. 

Hence in src/BltNsUtil.h we modified the external definitions of the TCL calls to mirror the ones in tcl.h. In src/bltScrollbar.c, src/bltTed.c, and 
src/BltVecMath.c we modified the way results are send back to TCL and finally in src/bltInit.c, we removed exact version number checking, as we are linking against a beta version of TCL that has an additional pattch level that BLT does not know how to deal with.

The changes mentioned were the only ones needed to fix BLT to run under TCL 8.6 using CMake.
