RELEASE NOTES

Program: Seg3D 1.12 
Date: 9-4-2009

Note:

Supported platforms:

[1] OSX: Seg3D 1.12 supports OSX 10.5 with a 32-bit version available.
Currently the 64-bit version of OSX does not compile with wxwidgets.

[2] Linux: Seg3D 1.12 supports most flavors of Linux, but requires the user to compile Seg3D from scratch.
NVIDIA graphics cards and drivers are recommended. 
Seg3D is shipped with most thirdparty software dependencies, but tools like gcc, g++,
Subversion and CMake need to be installed separately.

[3] Windows: Seg3D 1.12 currently runs on both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows Vista and Windows XP.

OpenGL requirement:

Seg3D volume rendering tools require OpenGL library version 2.0 or higher. Currently most Linux and OSX systems
have a recent enough OpenGL library.

Binary versions:

[1] Binary versions are available for Windows XP/Vista and OS X 10S X 10.5.

Source code:

[1] Source code of Seg3D is available from https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/, use svn to checkout the latest version of the code.
The latest code can be downloaded by:

svn co https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/cibc/cibc/trunk/ .

Documentation:

[1] Currently only the documentation of the old Seg3D version is available, and can be used as guidance
in this new Seg3D version.  We are developing a new documentation system for our software and apologize for not having
up to date documentation at this point.  Questions regarding Seg3D can always be posted to seg3d@sci.utah.edu


New Features:

[1] Everything now compiles using CMake.

[2] This version brings 64bit capability to Windows.

[3] A new configurable autosave feature has been added.  It defaults to autosaving in your home directory every 15 minutes.
This feature is configurable by going to Edit->Preferences and selecting either Set AutoSave Interval or Set AutoSave Directory

[4] A hotkey has been added for polyline tool.  Pressing delete (OSX) or backspace will delete the last point in the line.

[5] When the polyline tool's fill is used with a mask region, the masked region will be filled instead of everything but the masked region.  
Polyline fill now matches the behavior of the paintbrush tool.
