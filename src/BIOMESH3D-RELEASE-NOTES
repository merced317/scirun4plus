RELEASE NOTES

Program: BioMesh3D 0.1 (BETA 1)
Date: 9-4-2009

Note:

BioMesh3D is currently available as a source release.
Download via anonymous Subversion checkout:

svn checkout --username anonymous https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/cibc/cibc/branches/release_4.2

Supported platforms:

[1] OSX: BioMesh3D 0.1 supports OSX 10.5 and can be built in either 32-bit
and 64-bit mode.
The X11 package needs to be installed from the installation disk to use
the interactive BioMesh3D pipeline and the SCIRun volume rendering tools.
Note that some of the latest releases of the X11.pkg (2.3.1) contain bugs
that prevent BioMesh3D from running properly when compiled with 2.3.1 X11
libraries. We use X11.pkg version 2.2.0 which works fine with our
software.

[2] Linux: BioMesh3D 0.1 supports most flavors of Linux.
NVIDIA graphics cards and drivers are recommended. BioMesh3D is shipped
with most thirdparty software dependencies, tools like gcc, g++,
Subversion and CMake need to be installed separately.

[3] Windows: BioMesh3D 0.1 currently runs on both 64-bit and 32-bit
Windows Vista, although we recommend using the software on OSX or Linux.

OpenGL requirement:

BioMesh3D interactive pipeline and SCIRun volume rendering tools require
OpenGL library version 2.0 or higher. Currently most Linux and OSX systems
have a recent enough OpenGL library.

System requirements:

We recommend a minimum of 4 GB RAM and a dual core processor.

Limitations of this version:

Workarounds and further details for some limitations can be found in the
BioMesh3D documentation.

[1] The number of materials is limited to 9 domains.

[2] BioMesh3D requires 3D data.

[3] BioMesh3D is not currently optimized for large datasets and large
numbers of materials. Improvements in this area are forthcoming.

[4] Thin segmentations may be inaccurately meshed.

[5] Anisotropic data is treated as isotropic in the tightening step in
stage 1 of the pipeline.


Know bugs:

[1] Do not use the interactive pipeline over a forwarded X11 connection.

[2] Tetgen has been known to crash on 64-bit Windows Vista when generating
the volume mesh in stage 8 of the pipeline.

[3] Extra tetrahedral elements are not always removed from material
interfaces in stage 7 of the pipeline.


Documentation:

The BioMesh3D User Guide (pdf) is available on the CIBC wiki
